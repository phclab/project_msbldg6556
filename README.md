In this repository, there are two files.
“Arduino_LTS” is the file to upload to Arduino. With the file, Arduino can connect to the magnetic system.
The file “Scripts” is used to run the magnetic system. Open “GUI_Module.py” to start using the magnetic system and generating the electromagnetic field with the Arduino.
