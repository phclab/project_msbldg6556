##Description
  “Magnetic System” is a system to build and control the electromagnetic field in vivo and in vitro with Arduino.

  In this repository, there are two files.
  
“Arduino_LTS” is the file to upload to Arduino. With the file, Arduino can connect to the magnetic system.

The file “Scripts” is used to run the magnetic system. Open “GUI_Module.py” to start using the magnetic system and generating the electromagnetic field with the Arduino.

In GUI, the users can set up their own protocol to open and close the electromagnetic field at the time they want. Besides, with the sensors and the camera, the Magnetic System can monitor the environment in the mouse behavior test. 

##Requirement
Python 3.8.8

PyQt 5.15.7

Arduino IDE 2.3.3
